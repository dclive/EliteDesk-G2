 HP EliteDesk G2 DM Repository

OpenCore .82 with MacOS 12.5 fully tested and working

EliteDesk G2 800 DeskMini with firmware 2.56 (latest as of 5.22.2022)

iGPU, Samsung 960 NVME SSD, 32GB RAM - fully working, slow boot due to Samsung 960.

Integrated Intel Wifi/BT does not work / is not reliable; sleep doesn't work; otherwise everything works 

Note: Sleep doesn't work due to iGPU; there's no solution to this

Addendum:  As of 1/1/2023, firmware 2.59 works fine, as does OC87, all running under MacOS 12.6.1.  No further MacOS updates are possible with the current SMBIOS, but I'll look into updating that.
